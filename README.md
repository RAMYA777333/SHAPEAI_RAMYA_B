#SHAPEAI PYTHON AND DEEP LEARNING BOOTCAMP Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience leaming with SHAPEAI. <br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7z18TDRnbune5TnrfBgFbxT87E98cf09">

<li>Python

<li>Tensorflow <Deep Learning

<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.

I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
